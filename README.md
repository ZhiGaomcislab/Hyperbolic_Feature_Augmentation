# Hyperbolic_Feature_Augmentation
Code of the NeurIPS 2022 paper "Hyperbolic Feature Augmentation via Distribution Estimation and Infinite Sampling on Manifolds".

In our method, extracted features of the used datasets are required. Features of the mini-ImageNet and CUB datasets using the ResNet12 backbone can be downloaded here.



# Run the code

For the mini-ImageNet and CUB datasets, please run
